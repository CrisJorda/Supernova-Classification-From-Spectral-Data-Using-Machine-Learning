# Supernova-Classification-From-Spectral-Data-Using-Machine-Learning
The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning classification system to categorise core collapse supernovae into their type based on their spectra.
In this GitHub can be found the database utilised (original database from Weizmann Interactive Supernova Data Repository (WISeREP)) and the ones obtained after applying corrections, the excel file Characteristics table with the features of every spectrum in the database, the Python and Bash scripts created to develop the progect, and an XGBoost Classifier system.
